JOIN means to combine something. In case of SQL, JOIN means "to combine two or more tables".

In SQL, JOIN clause is used to combine the records from two or more tables in a database.

Types of SQL JOIN--

1)INNER JOIN
2)LEFT OUTER JOIN
3)RIGHT OUTER JOIN
4)FULL OUTER JOIN



1. INNER JOIN---

In SQL, INNER JOIN selects records that have matching values in both tables as long as the condition is satisfied. It returns the combination of all rows from both the tables where the condition satisfies.

Syntax-

SELECT table1.column1, table1.column2, table2.column1,....  
FROM table1   
INNER JOIN table2  
ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column;  

Query-

SELECT EMPLOYEE.EMP_NAME, PROJECT.DEPARTMENT   
FROM EMPLOYEE  
INNER JOIN PROJECT  
ON PROJECT.EMP_ID = EMPLOYEE.EMP_ID;  



2. LEFT OUTER JOIN----

The SQL left join returns all the values from left table and the matching values from the right table. If there is no matching join value, it will return NULL.

Syntax-

SELECT table1.column1, table1.column2, table2.column1,....  
FROM table1   
LEFT JOIN table2  
ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column; 


Query-

SELECT EMPLOYEE.EMP_NAME, PROJECT.DEPARTMENT   
FROM EMPLOYEE  
LEFT JOIN PROJECT  
ON PROJECT.EMP_ID = EMPLOYEE.EMP_ID;  



3. RIGHT OUTER  JOIN---

In SQL, RIGHT JOIN returns all the values from the values from the rows of right table and the matched values from the left table. If there is no matching in both tables, it will return NULL.

Syntax-

SELECT table1.column1, table1.column2, table2.column1,....  
FROM table1   
RIGHT JOIN table2  
ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column;  

Query-

SELECT EMPLOYEE.EMP_NAME, PROJECT.DEPARTMENT   
FROM EMPLOYEE  
RIGHT JOIN PROJECT  
ON PROJECT.EMP_ID = EMPLOYEE.EMP_ID;  


4. FULL OUTER JOIN---

In SQL, FULL JOIN is the result of a combination of both left and right outer join. Join tables have all the records from both tables. It puts NULL on the place of matches not found.

Syntax-

SELECT table1.column1, table1.column2, table2.column1,....  
FROM table1   
FULL JOIN table2  
ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column;  

Query-

SELECT EMPLOYEE.EMP_NAME, PROJECT.DEPARTMENT   
FROM EMPLOYEE  
FULL JOIN PROJECT   
ON PROJECT.EMP_ID = EMPLOYEE.EMP_ID;  



5. SELF JOIN----

A self join is a regular join , but the table is joined with itself.

Syntax-

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1 T1, table1 T2
WHERE condition;

Query-

SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, A.City
FROM Customers A, Customers B
WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID
AND A.City = B.City
ORDER BY A.City;
