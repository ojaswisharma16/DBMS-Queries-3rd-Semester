#SQL Index--

Indexes are special lookup tables. It is used to retrieve data from the database very fast.
An Index is used to speed up select queries and where clauses. But it shows down the data input with insert and update statements. Indexes can be created or dropped without affecting the data.
An index in a database is just like an index in the back of a book.
For example: When you reference all pages in a book that discusses a certain topic, you first have to refer to the index, which alphabetically lists all the topics and then referred to one or more specific page numbers.

1. Create Index statement--
It is used to create an index on a table. It allows duplicate value.

Syntax-

CREATE INDEX index_name  
ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);

Example-

CREATE INDEX idx_name  
ON Persons (LastName, FirstName); 

Composite Index:-
			CREATE INDEX index_name
			ON tablename(columnname,columnname);



2. Unique Index statement
It is used to create a unique index on a table. It does not allow duplicate value.

Syntax-

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name  
ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);  

Example-

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX websites_idx  
ON websites (site_name);



3. Drop Index Statement
It is used to delete an index in a table.

Syntax-

DROP INDEX index_name;  

Example-

DROP INDEX websites_idx;  








#Views in SQL----

Views in SQL are considered as a virtual table. A view also contains rows and columns.
To create the view, we can select the fields from one or more tables present in the database.
A view can either have specific rows based on certain condition or all the rows of a table.

1. Creating view--

A view can be created using the CREATE VIEW statement. We can create a view from a single table or multiple tables.

Syntax:

CREATE VIEW view_name AS  
SELECT column1, column2.....  
FROM table_name  
WHERE condition; 


2. Creating View from a single table--
In this example, we create a View named DetailsView from the table Student_Detail.

Query:

CREATE VIEW DetailsView AS  
SELECT NAME, ADDRESS  
FROM Student_Details  
WHERE STU_ID < 4;  
Just like table query, we can query the view to view the data.

SELECT * FROM DetailsView; 


3. Creating View from multiple tables--
View from multiple tables can be created by simply include multiple tables in the SELECT statement.

In the given example, a view is created named MarksView from two tables Student_Detail and Student_Marks.

Query:

CREATE VIEW MarksView AS  
SELECT Student_Detail.NAME, Student_Detail.ADDRESS, Student_Marks.MARKS  
FROM Student_Detail, Student_Mark  
WHERE Student_Detail.NAME = Student_Marks.NAME;  
To display data of View MarksView:

SELECT * FROM MarksView;


4. Deleting View--
A view can be deleted using the Drop View statement.

Syntax

DROP VIEW view_name;  
Example:

If we want to delete the View MarksView, we can do this as:

DROP VIEW MarksView;  




5.Renaming the columns of a view:-

Syntax:-
		CREATE VIEW viewname AS
		SELECT newcolumnnameâ€¦.
		FROM tablename
		WHERE columnname=expression_list;
    
    
    

6.Selecting a data set from a view-

Syntax:-
		SELECT columnname, columnname
		FROM viewname
		WHERE search condition;
